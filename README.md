# My_assign1_303
How to run my program:
1. I used VS code on my macbook
2. The code has a txt file(array.txt) with integer data values and a main(Amain.cpp), header file(array.h), function impelementations (array1.cpp)
3. Run the main file(Amain.cpp)
4. First it will read input values from the txt file and print the array.
5. I have given a random size for my array.
6. The code works fine with user inputs.

8. Every time the user adds a new value, the size of my array increases by one.
9. My functions work well with exceptions as well. There are two try-catch blocks in add_func3 and modify_func2. Whenever the user inputs an invalid value/index,it prints a message to inform the user.
10. At the end of my program, I printed my new array.
